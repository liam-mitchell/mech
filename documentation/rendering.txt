The renderer receives a list of images and a camera from the scene and is
responsible for rendering them appropriately.

Images contain:
  - World coordinates
  - Private image data (ie. SDL_Surface *)
  - A method for setting pixel position and size

Cameras contain:
  - Some method for culling images from a list to be rendered
  - Some method for setting the pixel position and size of an image

On each frame, the renderer will:
  - Ask the camera to cull images it can't see
  - Run through its list of images
  - For each image:
    - Ask the camera to set the pixel position and size of the image based
      on the width and height of the renderer's window
